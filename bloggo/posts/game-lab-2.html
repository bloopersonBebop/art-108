                    <p>For this post, I wanted to reflect on a few different games I played and made critical observations on using the MDA framework. Each one stood out in its own way, whether through mechanics, dynamics, or aesthetics, and they all gave me very different player experiences.</p>

                    <p>The first game I played was Don’t Shit Your Pants, which I’d describe as a puzzle adventure game. It’s a very silly game where you type in commands to prevent the character from shitting his pants (these typed commands are the core mechanics). There aren’t many options you can enter, but the ones you can are hilarious. That’s why I see it more as a puzzle. You need to figure out the right words to type. The dynamic of the game is typing commands that lead the character down different paths, depending on your choices. I would say the core aesthetic is mostly Discovery, since players are encouraged to replay and experiment with commands to uncover all the different endings, though there’s also a touch of Submission in its short, casual style.

                    <p>The second game I played was A Dance of Fire and Ice, which I decided to try after watching my partner Alex play. The mechanics are simple: the player presses the spacebar to the beat in order to progress. The dynamic here is listening closely to the rhythm, anticipating beat changes, and pressing the spacebar with precision. Otherwise, it’s game over. I think the key aesthetic is Sensation, because you rely on hearing and touch to match the beat, and it’s satisfying when you hit the rhythm just right.</p>

                    <p>Watching Alex play made me want to try the game because I love rhythm games. At first, I thought it looked incredibly easy and couldn’t figure out why he was struggling. But once I played it myself, I realized what makes it harder than a typical rhythm game. You don’t actually know the tune ahead of time, so you need to anticipate the rhythm as it develops, which makes it much more challenging.</p>

                    <p>The third game I played was This Is the Only Level, a fun and quirky Flash-style platformer where you play through just one level. The mechanics are simple—jumping and pressing buttons to reach the exit pipe, but each version of the level changes the rules, forcing the player to rethink their approach. The common pattern I noticed was always finding some way to press the button and make it to the pipe, even if the challenge looked familiar. The core aesthetic here was definitely Discovery, as each new twist made me figure out a different way to solve what looked like the same problem.</p>

                    <p>Overall, these three games show how different mechanics and dynamics can lead to very different player experiences. Don’t Shit Your Pants highlights humor and experimentation, A Dance of Fire and Ice focuses on rhythm and sensation, and This Is the Only Level uses on discovery through repetition with a twist. A critical connection I noticed is between A Dance of Fire and Ice and This Is the Only Level was that both games rely on players repeating the same type of challenge, but in A Dance of Fire and Ice the repetition comes from listening for rhythmic changes, while in This Is the Only Level it comes from adapting to new rules in a familiar space. Playing and thinking about them side by side really showed me how even simple games can create unique aesthetics by shaping how players interact with their systems.</p>
