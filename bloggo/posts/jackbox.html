                    <br><p>Last week I got to play Jackbox games during class. We played 3 different party games, but when our class played Dodo Re Mi from Jackbox Party Pack 10, I was instantly excited. I love rhythm games, so the idea of a group of musical birds performing to please a hungry plant sounded perfectly ridiculous in the best way. It is basically Rock Band if everyone were clumsy birds with questionable rhythm and no coordination.</p>
                    <p>The mechanics are simple at first. Each player taps their phone in time with the beat, controlling a part of the song such as drums, melody, or harmony. Together, we are supposed to create beautiful music to feed the god. In reality, our first round was a complete disaster. The sounds were all over the place, everyone was off-beat, and the plant was clearly not impressed with our noisy attempt at art.</p>
                    <p>By the second round, though, everything clicked. I got to play as one of the brids instead of in the audience, and this time we actually won. We performed March of the Bumblebee, which matched our frantic energy perfectly. The rhythm came together, people were cheering, and it felt like we finally understood how to make music as a team.</p>
                    <p>Even though only a few people were actually playing, it felt like the entire class was involved since the audience got to choose an instrument and play. Everyone reacted, laughed, and celebrated each mistake and success. The audience made the whole thing more exciting and turned it into a shared experience instead of just a game.</p>
                    <p>In the end, Dodo Re Mi was pure fun, full of rhythm, teamwork, and laughter. It proved that even a group of chaotic dodos can make something beautiful when they play together.
