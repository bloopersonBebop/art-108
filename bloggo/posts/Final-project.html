                    <h3>In the Dark, I See You</h3>
                        
                    <br><p>For my final project, I’m working with two programmers, Tiffany Huynh and Alexander Pham, and another artist, Joyce Wu. I’m also an artist, so originally the plan was that I would handle the daytime pixel art, Joyce would handle the nighttime art, and both programmers would split the mechanics. I pitched the initial idea for the game, which was a day and night system that slowly reveals a story through exploration, and everyone liked it enough that we decided to build the whole project around it. I really tried not to dominate the narrative and wanted everyone to have space to contribute ideas, especially since Tiffany was really excited about storytelling through environment and worldbuilding instead of just straight-up text.</p>

                    <p>We had a slow start, mostly because nobody was really writing the story yet. The programmers were understandably eager to start implementing mechanics, but for me, as the person making the art, it felt hard to create anything without knowing the emotional tone or direction. I eventually just took over writing the actual story because we needed something solid to work from, and that ended up being way more work than I expected. I love writing, but juggling that with the day art (which is pixel art, and pixel art is much harder than people think) started stressing me out.</p>

                    <p>During our first playtest, I’ll be honest, I was a little sad with what we had. We had some basic daytime mechanics, the nighttime character, and the gorgeous nighttime world, but no real story yet. The feedback we got was basically “The coffee interaction works” and “The night world is pretty.” That was the moment I realized we needed a narrative foundation right away. Joyce was actually totally fine taking over the daytime art so I could focus on writing, which helped a ton. Now, two weeks before it’s due, the full story is fleshed out, the dialogue is coming together, and we’re working on actual nighttime mechanics to make that section more gameplay heavy.</p>

                    <p>Even though this has been a lot, I’m really thankful. I didn’t really expect writing and directing the flow of the game to take so much energy. It’s my first time being in a sort of “director” role, and I’ve been trying really hard not to come off as bossy. But my teammates have been super supportive and keep saying they like the story and the direction. Alexander is working on the soundtrack, which is not what I imagined but honestly sounds really cool. Joyce’s art for the nighttime world has this clown-spaceship vibe that I never would have thought of, but it’s beautiful and totally works. It still feels like everyone is putting their own flair into the project, even though I’m shaping the core narrative.</p>

                    <p>I still feel like we don’t have much yet, but once everything is implemented, I think the game is going to be really cool. I’ll probably help out with some day assets once the writing is fully done, but so far this whole process has been fun, overwhelming, and kind of exciting. I’m looking forward to updating again once we’re closer to the final version.</p>
