                    <h3>Galaga '88</h3>
                    <p>I chose to play this specific game out of the hundreds that were offered on the Internet Archive because this is an arcade game that I've actually played using the machine. I would play back when I was still in elementary school, waiting for my brother to done with his orthodontist appointments. </p>
                    <p>While I've never been good at this arcade game, I'm not sure I ever made it past section 2 of the game, using the website was EXTREMELY CONFUSING! It uses an emulator, so nothing it asks you on the screen tells you what buttons to puch on the computer. Hell, it was asking me to insert a coin before I could even run the actual game. Now, if they had put a list of buttons to use somewhere in the description of the game that would have made this experience way more enjoyable to say the least. I had to pretty much mash my keyboard until things started working. It took roughly 10 minutes just to figure out the buttons to get the game going, and some additional finicking to even figure out how to shoot. It's not even in the reviews! Even once I started to play, I didn't find the button set up ideal, as it was way more difficult to control your ship than if you were using the actual machine.</p>
                    <p>Since I've played this game on a machine before I may be bias, but I actually prefer using just the joycon and the button over the emulator. While the computer does have clearer images and the soundtrack sounds amazing with the newer speaker technology, I find the simplicity of just a button and joycon to be easier to get into. You can be a little rougher with the machine, and button mash the buttons without worry. On the computer, even knowing the buttons to use, the arrow keys were a lot more diffucult to control, as well as the shoot button. But it is something to be expected when it comes to emulators. While it's nice to have a way to play nostolgic games, they almost always are way more difficult to play than playing the way the gmae was intended.</p>
