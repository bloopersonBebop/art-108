                    <br><p>This was such a fun semester. Honestly, this was probably the most fun elective I’ve ever gotten to take at San Jose State. I’ve grown up with video games basically being part of my personality, and some of my earliest memories are sitting at our really old computer playing <em>Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness</em> and <em>Betty Bad</em> with my dad. So getting to take a class where we didn’t just play games but actually talked about them, analyzed them, and even made them felt kind of like a full circle moment to me.</p>
                    <p>What I didn’t expect was how connected all the material would feel. We really did read about games, write about games, play games, design games, and each part kept feeding into the others. Reading helped me understand what developers and critics are actually thinking about. Playing games in class made me notice details I used to completely overlook. Writing about them forced me to put my thoughts into actual words instead of just vague feelings. And designing a game made everything suddenly way more real, like “Ohhh… this is why playtesting matters so much,” or “This is why pacing is so hard,” or “Wow, its kinda hard to not have any bugs in games.”</p>
                    <p>One of the strangest highlights for me was playing Super Columbine Massacre RPG. Not because it was a good game, but because it was interesting to play something that wasn’t meant to be fun. It totally shifted how I think about what games are allowed to be and what they can communicate. It made me see games as commentary, not just entertainment.</p>
                    <p>When I told a couple of my friends about it, they got really offended that I even wanted to play it. I wasn’t surprised by their reaction, since the game is obviously controversial, but it still sucked that they couldn’t understand why I wanted to experience it for myself. They insisted it never should have been made, no matter the context. For me, though, playing it actually helped me understand the event in a way that reading the news never did. Being put in a first person perspective and having to make horrifying choices created this heavy, uncomfortable feeling that stayed with me. Some parts were genuinely stomach dropping. That discomfort made the experience even more interesting, because it forced me to think about why we treat certain subjects as completely off limits and whether games can be a way to confront things we usually avoid. It challenged me, and that challenge ended up being one of the most valuable parts of the class.</p>
                    <p>But my absolute favorite part was getting to take the lead on writing and designing our game. I never thought I’d be the person saying “Okay, here’s the story, here’s the world, here’s how the mechanics fit together,” but it ended up being one of the coolest things I’ve done in college. Seeing it come to life, getting feedback, watching people actually play something I helped create… it felt weirdly magical. And now I definitely want to keep working on it, polishing it, and maybe even making it into something I could put on Steam one day. Who knows?</p>
                    <p>Overall, I learned way more than I expected, not in a stressful way but in a genuinely exciting way. Everything connected. Everything built on everything else. And for once in a college class, I wasn’t just learning because I had to. I was learning because I actually wanted to. This class reminded me why I love games so much, and it made me even more interested in how they’re made and why they matter.
