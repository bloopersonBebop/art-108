                    <h3>Shrooms</h3>
                    <p>So right now my working title for my game is called SHROOMS. It’s a board game similar to candy land, but you have to collect mushrooms to win. I designed it for 2 players but I believe it can easily go up to 4 or more depending on tweeks. It’s sort of a race to the finish, as each player must collect 4 mushrooms before their opponent and make it to the end to win. </p>
                    <p> I tried to incorporate a few different mechanics, such as Variable Set Up (placing slide logs where the players choose), Set Collection(players must collect a set of 4 mushrooms to win), Hand Management (players are allowed limited attack cards), Take That (the attack cards), Push your Luck (having normal mushrooms AND special mushrooms that are both good and bad for you), possibly Variable Powers ( the mushrooms do give the players special effects that change how they interact with the game), and Track Movement.</p>
                    <p>But the core mechanic to this game is Roll / Spin and Move, as it’s what the players are doing every single turn without fail and it’s how the player’s pretty much progress through the game. This mechanic defines how the players will interact with each other, as well as the decisions they will have to make because of their rolls.</p>

                    <h4>Rules:</h4>
           
                    <li>Each player rolls the dice to move along the board.</li>
                    <li>Land on a mushroom space to collect a mushroom (normal = safe, fancy = risky with random effects, can be positive or negative, or just funny).</li>
                    <li>Players can use attack cards to hinder opponents, but only one card per turn.</li>
                    <li>To win, you must collect 4 mushrooms and reach the “Mushroom Market,” (also known as the final square space on the board).</li>
                    <li> If you arrive without enough mushrooms, you must loop back and keep playing.</li>

                        I came into the first session with a vague idea of what I wanted to implement. I wanted to make a game with something similar to the game Poetry for Neanderthals, a party game where you interact with your fellow players and hijinks ensue. My partner Ethan came into the session with a much more concise plan of what he wanted, with mechanics like Tech Trees/Tech Tracks and Market resources. I found that it felt hard to really mix our two ideas since Ethan seemed very dead set on his ideas, so we rolled with the game he wanted to make. We ended up making a game similar to Machi Koro, where we used resources to build different buildings to create a city and the first to build town hall won. While I did have fun during this session, it started to feel very complicated for me, especially because of the 1 hour time constraint we had to actually create the game. I waaaas able to input that the players should race against each other to build town hall and barter resources,which I found made the game more interesting for me. These 2 components are what I brought into my 2nd prototype, even though I did change the game quite a bit.

                    <h4>Session 2 (at home with my family):
                    </h4>
                       <p>
                        At this point I had changed the game from being centered around cards to a game with a board and path. I set it up so you had to collect mushrooms to win, and whoever collected the most before the end won. I had mushrooms do special abilities and that the players could exchange mushrooms with each other, but when I put it into play it wasn’t really very fun. Because I made it so that mushrooms were picked up on the board, and there weren’t many spaces, the game felt pretty boring. Players were getting maybe, maybeeee 3 mushrooms at most which wasn’t very fun after playing. I knew I needed to add more, and make it more competitive so I started adding more mechanics in hopes of making it more competitive.

                    <h4> Session 3 (back in class):</h4>
                    <p>This is the game that had all the mechanics that were listed at the beginning. Much more fun in my opinion! And it had players interacting with each other a lot more, using attack cards and such. I will say even though I added a lot more mushroom pick up squares on the board, it still felt difficult to get them. If I were to continue revising, I would make something like a mushroom bank or a separate way to collect mushrooms so your run isn’t based mostly on the luck of your dice rolls.</p>

                       <p>
                        This was a very fun exercise for me! It made me think a lot more about what goes into a good game and even if I had good ideas in theory, they don’t always work when put together, but that’s ok. It’s what leads to better, more fun and interesting games.
