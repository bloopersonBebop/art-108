                    <p>Jelly Jumpers is a game about 2 jellies platforming together to become a jelly sandwich. My programmer, Alex Pham, pretty much let me choose this idea while he came up with the really cool game mechanics like the jellies pulling together and having it be a local multiplayer game.</p>

                    <p>After the first playtesting session, I was pretty suprised to find that our game out of the rest of the class felt the most completed. We came in with a full level done while a lot of our other classmates had some almost finished levels. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Both people who had sat with me during our playtest were very blown away with what we had to offer, with one of them even wanting to finish the level with me before he moved on to trying another game! Our first playtester did give some good feedback like how fustrating it was not having some kind of checkpoint system and that some interactible objects were unclear, and the second playtester brought up a very great point that some of the jumps while possible, were extrememly difficult for a first time player.</p>

                    <p>Going into the working prototype, we definetly will be creating checkpoints and reimagining some of the jumps. I think thats what makes it great about having 2 people on a team. My programmer is very passionate about the game which is amazing, but I think since he tests out the mechanics regularly its hard for him to know what's actually pretty hard, and I'm able to see it since I don't play it as often!
