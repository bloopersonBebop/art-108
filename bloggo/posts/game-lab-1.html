                    <br><p>On Wednesday, the third of September, I got to play a game called Secret Hitler for the first time! While there is no actual Hitler propaganda, it is a game all about using your intuition skills to find out who you can trust and who you must decieve to win the game. </p>
                    <p> I honestly assumed it was the exact same game as Wolf, which is also a very fun by the way. To my suprise, while they both share the same the mechanisms, Secret Hitler has way more rules and things you need to set up before you can actually start the game. I was honestly quite confused about it, so confused that I may or may not have seen who my fellow fascists were when I was Hitler. <em>(something you're definetly not supposed to do)</em></p>
                    <p>I got to play with a group of 10 people, though because of limitied time we were only able to get 2 games in. By the end of the first game, our entire table seemed to be having fun even though most of us did not know eachother.</p>

                    <h4>Pregame:</h4>
                       <p>
                        Before the game started, all 10 players knocked on the table so the fascists could identify themselves and who Hitler was before the game officially started. The knocking was implemented so the liberal players would not be able to identify who the fascists were at the table. For this game, Mara, Carter, Sunny were all fascists and Lex was Hitler. Due to some confusion, Lex opened her eyes as well because she thought, in her words, “well I'm technically part of the fascist party so I thought I was supposed to open them,” which confused both Mara and Sunny. Once Lex identified herself as Hitler, everyone closed their eyes again and the game started.

                    <h4> Presidency 1</h4>
                    <p>Immy started their Presidency by electing Akari as chancellor, the people agreeded as Akari won majority vote. Immy then picked up the first 3 policies of the game, discarded one, and slid the remaining 2 policies over to the chancellor. The first policy to be chosen turned out to be a fascist policy. This sparked the first debate between all the players. During the debate, President Immy was given the ability to see a party member's party stace, which they chose to see Lex' due to their rising suspicions. Afterwards, they claimed Lex was in fact a fascist and the next Presidency started.</p>
                    <p>Fascist Policies Passed: 1
                    <br> Liberal Policies Passed: 0

                        <h4> Presidency 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lex was the second President of the game session, and decided to elect Carson as her chancellor. With another majority vote, Lex pulled 3 policies. After discarding one and sliding the remaining 2 to Carson, the chancellor put the first Liberal policy into play. This did not amuse Immy in the slightest. They doubled down on Lex being a fascist and Carson being a fascist now too. Lex then pointed out how it was crazy how during the current Presidency a Liberal policy was passed but during Immy's a fascist polict got passed. Immy did NOT enjoy that response, accusing everyone of being a fascist at this point, except Mara who had been very chill throught the game to this point.
                        <br>
                        <br><em>(Side note: Before the Liberal policy was put into play, the chancellor's discarded policy choice was accidentally revealed to the group. This showed that President Lex gave the chancellor 2 Liberal policies, going against Immy's fascist claims.)</em>

                        <h4> Presidency 3</h4>
                    <p>The next Presidency was given to Mara, who then elected Carter to be her Chancellor. With no complaints from the rest of of the players, they went on to pass the next Fascist policy, sparking more debate between the rest of the group. During this time, President Mara was given the ability to look at another player's party affiliation. During the chaos, she <em>quietly</em> inspected Akari without mentioning anything to the group. Because of all the commotion, this seemed to go unnoticed as no one asked about what Mara saw, instead the game continued to the next Presidency.</p>
                    <p>Fascist Policies Passed: 2
                        <br> Liberal Policies Passed: 1

                        <h4> Presidency 4</h4>
                    <p>Owen Goes on to take the reins of President and at this point, he is starting to have some serious doubts of who to trust. This causes his to randomly appoint Jake as his Chancellor, seemingly not giving this decision too much thought. After jake gets sworn in by the player counsel, Carson throws a stray towards Immy about all the suspicious accusations they'd been spewing all game. While Immy begins to defend their logic with the "I know" defense, they also reiterate that Lex is an actual fascist. This causes Lex to defend themselves and say they have a blue liberal card like everyone else. Immy's nuerons instantly begin firing, causing a new debate between the two about the actual party color cards to try and proved eachother wrong. They debated for so long, that most of the other players dind't know what was happening anymore, especially Martin. </p>
                    <p>During this debate, Owen and Jake pass the second Liberal policy, and the game continues.

                        <h4> Presidency 5</h4>
                    <p>Because of seating order, Jake was the next President and he chose Sunny to be his Chancellor. During this Presidency, Sunny ended up choosing to pass a fascist policy, puting the fascists back into the lead. Owen, Jake and Immy begin to have talks of where Sunny's true loyalties lie. Meanwhile, since this was the third fascist policy to take effect, President Jake is given the power to choose who they wish to be the next President, and Jake gives this power back to who it all started with: Immy.
                    <p>Fascist Policies Passed: 3
                        <br> Liberal Policies Passed: 2
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h4> Presidency 6</h4>
                    <p>As tensions rise, Immy goes with the only person they claim they can trust for chancellor: Akari. This make's Akari feel pressured, and they ask everyone to not vote them into power. These pleas go unheard, as majority vote in favor for Akari's logical decision making. But to everyone's suprise, next policy to be passed is yet another Fascist policy, sparking outrage from the group. Akari is blaming Immy, Immy is blaming the limited policy cards, and Sunny takes this opportunity to throw heat back over to Jake. It's straight up yap central at the table, meanwhile Akari was trying their best to weed out the inconsistent statements coming from Sunny.</p>
                    <p>With the fourth Fascist policy passed, President Immy was now given the power to eliminate one of the players at the table. Immediently they discuss killing Lex,causing Lex to plead for her life. Lex gets real with Immy about her politcal party, and tries to reason that while they may be a fascist, they are not actually Hitler. She tells Immy that if they decided to kill her, that Immy would be wasting their bullet. Owen agrees, saying killing someone sitting next to you is a true betrayal, so Immy takes his advice and kills him instead.</p>
                    <p><em>(Side note: After his untimely death, Owen reveals he truly was a Liberal) </em></p>
                    <p>Fascist Policies Passed: 4
                        <br> Liberal Policies Passed: 2

                        <h4> Presidency 7</h4>
                    <p>Going into the seventh Presidency, everyone is on edge. Most of the group stopped trusting eachother making the game feel like a free for all at this point. Carson is now the president and before he can even elect a chancellor everyone already started debating who he should choose. Lex says that he should choose her due to them being government buddies during Lex's Presidency, to which he reluctantly aggrees. Immy, in a final attempt to make their case against Lex, pleads for everyone to vote against her. Lex in turn tries to calm Immy and the table by saying that since her card said Fascist, she clearly wasn't Hitler.</p>

                    <p>Although almost half the group was still skeptical, Lex managed to win majority vote becoming chancellor. Once the vote was completed, Lex then revealed her true role as Hitler, winning the game for the Fascist party.</p>
                   
                    <p>Hitler Elected Chancellor: Fascists Won</p>
