                    <p>Jelly Jumpers is a local multi-player game where you and a friend play as Strawberry Jam (SJ) and Grape Jelly (GJ) with a shared goal of becoming spread on toast! There are a total of 3 levels and you must collect a piece of toast, a plate, and a knife. SJ used a and d to move, q to go to teleport to a checkpoint and e to pull towards GJ. GJ uses j and l to move, o to go teleport to a checkpoint and u to pull towards SJ. They both share the space bar to jump. My programmer, Alex Pham, worked out most of our issues, but there is a way to make the jellies do a super jump by accident, which we incorporated into one of our levels!</p>

                    <p>Honestly, I'm really excited about how far the game has come since Alpha! I worked on the game as the Artist but Alex did let me design one of the levels (level 2). He did most of the hard work so it made it very easy to build when I opened it in Unity, but it was a very cool experience. He even made a little document guide on how he programmed the different elements and how I could add them into the game. In the alpha, we pretty much only had the tutorial level. I think we got a lot of good feedback from the playtest session like adding in checkpoints and more sprites. I'm happy I got to work with the programmer I did because he pushed to make Jelly Jumpers a full game where I would have been happy just having it as a tutorial level only. I think there is still more that could be done, I would love to revamp level 2 as I think I made it way too easy in comparison to level 3, but I'm just very happy with what we were able to accomplish in a month!
